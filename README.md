# .NETPriorityQueue
 A custom priority queue implementation using a binary heap in C#. It (as far as I know) conforms to most .NET standards. Not thread-safe.

## Information
This code was converted from a java project into something that takes advantage of C#'s feature set and that is more architecturally sound. While the original java code was extensively tested, I have not (yet!) written a test suite for this code. All of the algorithms and the logic behind them should be perfectly correct, however.
